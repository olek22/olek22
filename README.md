At the beginning of my professional career 
path, I would like to expand my knowledge 
and abilities I have already learned by getting 
a job.
Iâ€™m conscientious and willing to learn. My 
teamwork skills have been developed as
a leader in student activities. From planning 
events for groups of students to finished 
project presentation.</p>
